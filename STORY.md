# Discount Ascii Warehouse story

This is an **unusual** kind of changelog, which I decided to call "story". Instead of listing only changes in code, I also comment the development process. The goal of this file is to make it easier for the application review team to evaluate my steps.

## 1st hour of work

1. Quick overview of backend code
2. Testing server on Postman
3. Building minimal docs on Postman for reference
4. Git: initialize git, gitignore, commit server code and start branch `boilerplate`

## 2nd hour of work

1. ESLint: extend airbnb and ignore server files
